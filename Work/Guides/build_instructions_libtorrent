extract all from the JNI folder.

MODIFY CONTENTS
In Libtorrent source, adapt file.cpp: 
Change ifdef __NR_fallocate to: ifndef __NR_fallocate

Add the previously build Boost libraries to libboost and make sure the filenames of these libraries in Android.mk are correct
In Application.mk, change or add APP_ABI to APP_ABI := armeabi armeabi-v7a

BUILD LIBTORRENT LIBS
In a terminal:
Go to the folder where RuTracker resides: cd path/to/RuTracker
Issue the following commands:

After a while it should have created the libraries libtorrent.so for both armeabi and armeabi-v7a in the libs folder.
