	\begin{itemize}
	\item all-in-one play\\
	The team reported that when you open the torrent, VLC starts immediately and downloads the file sequentially.
	\item buffer progress bar\\
	When watching this view there is a buffer progress bar over the normal play bar that shows how far the file is downloaded.
	\end{itemize}
\item[-] Encountered impediments\\
\item[-] End of file\\
The team reports that VLC doesn't always understand the end of file so it can't seek in the file.
\item[-] Presentation\\
The Supervisor wants to hear what is done by the Team itself in the presentation, just like the contributions in the final report.\\
The Team reports that the app needs to watch the playback position so it can start downloading there.\\
The Client advises to let the last downloaded or watched video sit in the memory, if a new torrent is started, it will overwrite that one.\\
He also said that the Team might want to change the VLC wiki to incorporate the build instructions from our report.
