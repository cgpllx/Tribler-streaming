\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, the functional-, nonfunctional requirements and constraints are elucidated. The functional requirements are requirements that pertain to the way the system should function. The nonfunctional requirements describe how the system should operate, using terms such as speed, design, user-friendliness and optimization of costs. The last section: constraints, describe the limits of the development process and proposed system. It can include constraints such as the date on which the system must be ready. The functional- and nonfunctional requirements are prioritized according to the MoSCoW method, as explained in the Plan of Action (section 3.6.2).
