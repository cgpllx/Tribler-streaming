\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, the functional-, nonfunctional requirements and constraints are ellicitated. The functional requirements are requirements that pertain to the way the system should function. The nonfunctional requirements describe how the system should operate, using terms such as speed, user-friendliness and optimisation of costs. The last section, constraints, describe the limits of the development process and proposed system, this can include constraints like the date on which the system must be ready.
