The project members each already own a laptop, which they will use for all the required software development and document creation. The client has arranged an office room at the department of the PDS group where the project members can work full-time. All the software that is required to perform the project tasks is open-source and freely distributed over the Internet. In case additional hard- or software is required during the project, the project members will ask the client for the required funding of these procurements.
