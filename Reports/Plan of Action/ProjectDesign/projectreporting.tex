\section{Project Reporting}
In order to communicate with the client effectively, both oral and written communication will be utilized. Informal meetings with the client will be held in person on a weekly basis. Written communication will be performed by means of using an IRC\footnote{http://www.irchelp.org/} channel , as well as e-mail. All reports within the project will be written using the LaTeX\footnote{http://www.latex-project.org/} typesetting system, and will be released as LaTeX source code, as well as in PDF\footnote{http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html} format. All released project material, including reports, source code and documentation will be uploaded to an online GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/} repository to which the client has access at all times. Apart from the client, communication with the supervisor will also be done orally and in writing. Weekly progress meetings will be held with the supervisor. The contents and results of these meetings will be documented in seperate reports.
