As mobile internet traffic continues to consistently gain on desktop traffic in terms of volume, a desire for a mobile version of Tribler was expressed by the client: Dr. Ir. Johan Pouwelse. This desire was formulated into a Bachelor project, which will be executed within a period of 11 weeks by Martijn Breet and Jaap van Touw. The project is centered around answering the following research question: \textit{``How can we make video-on-demand available for mobile devices using a non-centralized approach?''}. The goal of the project is to make a prototype of a mobile application for Android that features Video on Demand through a Peer-to-Peer network. During the design- and implementation phase of the project, several methods are used, such as Scrum, Test Driven Development, and MoSCoW prioritization. Additionally, a version control system is used to keep track of the history of all documents and source code. All created documents will be reviewed by a supervisor: Cor-Paul Bezemer, MSc. At two points in time during the final phases of the project, the Software Improvement Group will do a full source code evaluation.
