\section{Background and Motivation}
Distribution of radio and television programs, movies, music, ring-tones, games, and various data applications to the general public is possible today via a variety of dedicated networks and special end-user terminals. As broadband Internet becomes ubiquitous in both desktop and mobile device environments, all content distribution services will be combined and conveyed to the general public via a common pipeline, the Internet. Today several technologies are used for the media distribution across the Internet: unicast, IP multi-cast, content distribution networks, and most recently Peer-to-Peer. P2P is considered by many as an efficient, reliable, and low cost mechanism for distributing any media file or live stream, and it is used extensively \cite{internet_study}. Much of the current research activities in P2P within the PDS group are centered around Tribler\footnote{http://www.tribler.org}. Tribler is an application that enables its users to find, enjoy and share content through a P2P network. Tribler builds on BitTorrent\footnote{http://www.bittorrent.com} and is available on desktop environments. Currently mobile internet traffic continues to consistently gain on desktop traffic in terms of volume\footnote{http://gs.statcounter.com/mobile\_vs\_desktop\-ww\-monthly\-200812\-201306} and mobile traffic is estimated to surpass traffic from wired devices in 2017\footnote{\url{http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/VNI\_Hyperconnectivity\_WP.pdf}}. In response to this growth and to meet the increasing demands of the market, the development of a mobile version of Tribler would be of great value.
