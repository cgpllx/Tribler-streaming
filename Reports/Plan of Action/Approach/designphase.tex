\section{Design Phase}
As a first step in the design phase, functional-, nonfunctional requirements and constraints for the prototype will be elicited. From these requirements, usecases will be derived that convey how the system should interact with the user. Based on these requirements and use cases, an architectural design document will be created, consisting of a description of the proposed software architecture including subsystem decomposition, persistent data management, global resource handling, concurrency, software control and boundary conditions. Next, a detailed description of the packages, class diagram and a specification of the classes and methods is given in the Technical Design Document. Finally, a Test- and Implementation Plan is created that describes how the different features of the prototype will be tested and implemented.
