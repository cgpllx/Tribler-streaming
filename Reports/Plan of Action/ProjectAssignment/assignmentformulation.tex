\section{Assignment Formulation}
In this project, a prototype of the P2P-based video-on-demand mobile application will be realised, that will allow users to search for videos on the Internet. Once the user has found a video to his or her liking, and issued a ‘play’ command, the application will play the video by means of streaming it through a P2P-based network. The application will also feature the possibility to seek to different parts of a video, by means of a slider, that can be adjusted by the user.
