\section{Goal}
The goal of the project will be to create a prototype application for mobile devices, that allows users to enjoy video-on-demand through the Internet, using a non-centralized P2P network architecture. The application will allow users to search for a video, which will start playing after the user presses a play button. Additional seeking functionality will also be provided.
