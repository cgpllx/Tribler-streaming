check readme for building python-for-android here:
https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android

Python-to-Android currently only works with the 32-bit version of Android NDK (r9 works)

This is the step by step instruction (from http://python-for-android.readthedocs.org/en/latest/toolchain/):

0. clone the repository from d3vgru or kivy:
git clone https://github.com/d3vgru/python-for-android
(or https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android)

1. Install necessary libraries:
sudo apt-get install build-essential patch git-core ccache ant python-pip python-dev

2. Install the following as well if you are on 32 bit:
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs and libc6-dev-i386

3. Ensure that you have the latest version of cython:
pip install --upgrade cython

4. Ensure you have the Android NDK and SDK
	download SDK from: 	http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
	Download NDK from:	http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

5. Edit environment variables:
	sudo gedit /etc/environment
	
	put in the following lines in (substitute path and the Xs for the correct path and version/level):
	ANDROIDSDK=/path/to/android-sdk
	ANDROIDNDK=/path/to/android-ndk
	ANDROIDNDKVER=rX
	ANDROIDAPI=X

	also add to PATH:
	:$ANDROIDNDK:$ANDROIDSDK/platform-tools:$ANDROIDSDK/tools:$PATH

6. When this is done, do the following to build a distribution:
./distribute.sh -m "name of modules" -d 'name of dist'
(substitute with the correct names, for modules try: -m "openssl kivy pil" as example)

7. Now it has built a distribution, which is located in /dist/default if -d isn't used and otherwise in the name it was given at -d "name":
cd dist/name

8. Now create the .apk:
./build.py --package package-name --name program-name \
--version version --dir path/to/python/program debug

substitute the following:
package-name with a valid package name, example: org.test.touchtracer
program-name with the name of the program, example: touchtracer
version with version number, example: 1.0
path/to/python/program with the path to your python program, example: ../../build/kivy/kivy-master/examples/demo/touchtracer (for kivy git repo, use: ../../build/kivy/kivy-stable/examples/demo/touchtracer

./build.py --package org.test.touchtracer --name touchtracer \
--version 1.0 --dir ../../build/kivy/kivy-master/examples/demo/touchtracer debug installd

you can add installd behind debug to automatically install the .apk to your Android device, the .apk itself will be in the dist/name/bin folder
