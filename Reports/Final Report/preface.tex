This document entails the work of a Computer Science Bachelor project executed at the Delft Technical University within the Parallel and Distributed Systems group. During the different phases of this project I was helped by a lot of people and would like to offer my gratitude to the following people in particular: \\

\emph{Cor-Paul Bezemer}, for his expert supervision, guidance and input.\\

\emph{Johan Pouwelse}, for his positive support, input and visionary influence.\\

\emph{Jan-Willem van Velzen}, for his fortunate mistake, partnership and his tireless effort in making a good application.\\

\emph{Egbert Bouman}, for his sublime coding tip at a most fortunate time.\\
