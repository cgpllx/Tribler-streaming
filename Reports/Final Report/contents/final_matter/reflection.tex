The project was not without stride and difficulties, but this was one of its many charms. In the end I think we delivered on satisfactory level, given the time and delays in the first stage of the project. When Martijn left, I understood that not a waking moment should pass without me working or thinking on the project, if I wanted to finish on the previously set deadline. Jan-Willem was of great help in trying to accomplish the latter. When I was busy trying to figure out how I could compile components such as libtorrent and Boost, he went on to implement my ideas. 
I learned about many things such as native code on Android, Python, the Boost libraries, P2P networks and the inner workings of VLC. Also on a more personal level, I learned how to manage expectations and deal with people that don't deliver content on time. 
I had a lot of fun during the project and was happy to work on cutting edge technology with the possibility of creating a lot of impact in the world. An application such as the one here has not yet been seen on the market in a non-centralized way, which motivates me to continue working on this application.
