\section{Future Work}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
There is much work that could be done after this project. In the requirements elicitation there were a lot of features that could be implemented. But, due to the limited time the Team has, only implemented a subset of these requirements. Future work could entail Dispersy support, searching functionality, Libswift support and video uploading. Furthermore, the application could be extended to other mobile platforms such as iOS and Windows Phone. The application itself is not released yet beyond the scope of this project. Lately there has been a lot of news about governments listening in on private conversations between people and watching their data traffic across the Internet\footnote{\url{http://investigations.nbcnews.com/\_news/2013/06/06/18809021-sources-us-intelligence-agencies-tap-servers-of-top-internet-companies}}. To combat this, a release of a more mature version of the application in the Google Play store would be able to generate a lot of publicity for Tribler and its goal to create a censorship-free Internet\footnote{https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki}. Another feature that the Tribler team is working at, is anonymous tunneling, in which Tribler facilitates anonymous data traffic. To implement this in the Android application would be another huge step towards creating a censorship-free Internet.
