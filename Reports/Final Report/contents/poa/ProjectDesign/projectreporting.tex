\section{Project Reporting}
In order to keep the client up to date, both oral and written communication will be utilized. Informal meetings with the client will be held in person on a weekly basis. Written communication will be performed by means of using an IRC\footnote{http://www.irchelp.org/} channel , as well as per e-mail. Apart from the client, communication with the supervisor will also be done orally and in writing. Weekly sprint meetings will be held with the supervisor. The agendas and minutes of these meetings will be documented. All project documentation will be written using the LaTeX\footnote{http://www.latex-project.org/} typesetting system, and will be released as LaTeX source code, as well as in PDF\footnote{http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html} format. All released project material, including source code and documentation will be uploaded to an online GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/javto/bsc-project} repository which is publicly available at all times.
