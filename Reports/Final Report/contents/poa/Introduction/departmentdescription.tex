\section{Department description}
The Parallel and Distributed Systems group is a research group within the Software and Computer Technology department, which is part of the Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science of the Delft University of Technology. The research within the PDS group concentrates on the modeling, the design, the implementation, and the analysis of parallel and distributed systems and algorithms. Most of this research is experimental: the aim is to build prototypes of systems, preferably used in the real world, to demonstrate the quality of the proposed solutions. The main research areas of the PDS group are Peer-to-Peer systems and online social networks, massive multi-player online games, grids, clouds, multi-core architectures and parallel programming.
