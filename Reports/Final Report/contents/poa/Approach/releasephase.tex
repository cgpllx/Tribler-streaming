\section{Release Phase}
In this final stage of the project, all the documents that were created during the previous phases of the project will be bundled into one final report. This will include a general conclusion and evaluation. After handing in the Final Report to the stakeholders, the source code of the prototype is sent to the SIG one more time for a final evaluation. The finished prototype will then be presented to the client, bachelor coordinator and supervisor.
