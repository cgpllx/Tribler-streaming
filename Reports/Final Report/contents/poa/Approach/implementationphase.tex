\section{Implementation Phase}
\label{sec:sig}
Building the application is the main part of the project and consists of implementing the different components that were derived in the Design Phase. The source code of the prototype will be sent to the SIG for a thorough review on the 5th of September. The feedback provided by the SIG will be used to improve the code during the implementation phase.
