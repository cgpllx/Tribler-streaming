\section{Boundary Conditions}
The prototype application will run on an Android-based mobile device and will communicate with other peers through the Internet using the BitTorrent protocol. Therefore in order for the prototype application to work, an Internet connection is required. The bandwidth of the Internet connection should be equivalent to an average broadband DSL connection (10-20Mbit/s). Once the system is started it can be closed either by selecting `close' from a context menu, by terminating the application with the task manager in Android, or by rebooting the device. In order to facilitate smooth video playback, the device on which the prototype is run should contain hardware that is capable of playing back (decoding) 1080p at 30 fps.
