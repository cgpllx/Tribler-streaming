\chapter{Proposed Architecture}
In this chapter the proposed prototype will be separated into different subsystems to give more insight into how the team will build the system. First the different subsystems will be elucidated, followed by an explanation on how the different subsystems interact with each other. The way the system stores data is clarified in Section \ref{sec:perdata}. Different threads might try to alter the same part of data which causes a concurrency issue, when this would be possible and how the team will attempt to solve this is described in Section \ref{sec:conc}. How information flows from subsystem to subsystem in different use cases can be seen in Section \ref{sec:softctrl}. In the final section, we will explain how the system will deal with starting and stopping as well as crashes, how this will be implemented is explained in the final section.
