At the 29th of August, the Team had a meeting with the Supervisor in which Jaap van Touw brought to light that Martijn Breet had not done anything for the deadline that week. Martijn was given one more chance to make up for lost time, but he decided to stop his participation on the third of September. In this same timespan, the Client brought in the helping hand of Jan-Willem van Velzen. He was brought in as an external developer to help with programming. From then on he programmed approximately four days per week to help finish the prototype for the 2nd of October.
