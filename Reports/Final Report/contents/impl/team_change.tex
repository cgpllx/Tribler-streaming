At the 29th of August, the Team had a meeting with the Supervisor in which came to light that Martijn Breet had not done anything for the deadline. He was given one more chance to make up for lost time, but decided to stop his participation in the project on the third of September. In this same timespan, the Client brought in the helping hand of Jan-Willem van Velzen. Jan-Willem was then treated as an external developer, who helped with programming. He programmed for about four days in the week to help finish the prototype for the 2nd of October.
