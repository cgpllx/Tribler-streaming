A vital part of Tribler is the protocol with which, it downloads the torrents. As explained in Section \ref{sec:libtorrent_descr} this protocol is Libtorrent. Because the python code of Tribler proved too time-consuming to port to Android with the Python for Android project, the Team fell back on the risk analysis in Section \ref{sec:ra} and choose to implement Libtorrent. 
This part describes how Libtorrent and VLC were combined into one prototype application to stream videos. Section \ref{sec:teamchange} describes how the team formation changed going into the implementation phase. The following chapter describes how VLC was implemented on Android. How the Libtorrent libraries were built and included in the prototype is explained in Section \ref{sec:libtorrent_impl}. The following step was combining VLC and Libtorrent, how this was done is explained in Section \ref{sec:one_apk}. The final section describes how streaming was achieved.
