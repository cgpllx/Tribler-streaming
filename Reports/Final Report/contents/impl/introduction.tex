A vital part of Tribler is the protocol with which, it downloads the torrents. As explained in Chapter \ref{sec:libtorrent_descr} this protocol is libtorrent. Because the python code of Tribler proved too time-consuming to port to Android with the Python for Android project, the idea of, for now, only implementing libtorrent came to mind.
This part describes how libtorrent and VLC were combined in to one prototype application to stream videos. Chapter \ref{sec:teamchange} describes how the team changed going in to the implementation phase. The following chapter describes how VLC was implemented on Android. How the libtorrent libraries were build and included in to the prototype is explained in Chapter \ref{sec:libtorrent_impl}. The following step was combining VLC and libtorrent, how this was done is explained in Chapter \ref{sec:one_apk}. The next chapter describes how streaming was achieved.
