The next part to implement is to download the media file while VLC plays it at the same time. By making two threads, one for downloading and one for VLC, the application could download while the user watches the video. To make this a smooth experience, the Team implemented a buffer, which filled until the buffer was large enough, so that the user could continuously watch the video. This is based on the average speed and the file-size of the video to be streamed. In the end, the download algorithm wasn't implemented as described in Section \ref{sec:download_alg}. The prototype sets libtorrent to download pieces in sequential mode as advised by the Tribler team.
