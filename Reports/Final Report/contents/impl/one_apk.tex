\section{Combining VLC and Libtorrent}

\label{sec:one_apk}
The Team wanted to deliver the streaming application with VLC built-in. This way, the user can play a video without having to worry about installing the right media framework. To achieve this, the Team tried to let VLC act like a library from which the libtorrent client application could call functions for playback. However, VLC for Android wasn't build with this purpose in mind, as the team discovered after some experimentation. The Team fused the two projects together by putting the source of the libtorrent client application together with VLC in one project. The Team now had one .apk file, which can be installed. At this stage, it first downloads the file and then calls the VLC part of the prototype to play the media file.
