\section{Problem Statement}
As the previous section hinted, the following problem exists:\\
\\
\textit{``How can we make video-on-demand available for mobile devices using a non-centralized approach?''}\\

This research question consists out of three main elements: VoD, mobile devices and a non-centralized approach. These are the topics of  the following sub questions.

\subsection{Sub questions}
VoD is the main feature that needs to be considered for implementation, which raises the following question:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit{``Which solutions exist for VoD on (non-)mobile devices''}\\
	\\if no solutions exist for mobile devices, the following questions are of grave importance:\\
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item\textit{``How can a port of an existing non-mobile solution be made to mobile devices?''}\\
			\\and\\
			\item\textit{``What are the limitations of such a ported solution to mobile devices?''}\\
		\end{enumerate}
	Furthermore, the problem of centralization needs to be addressed:\\
	\item\textit{``Which (ported) solutions for VoD use a non-centralized approach?''}\\
	\\Finally, research has to be conducted into the following:\\
	\item\textit{``Which mobile platforms are best suited to implement VoD in a non-centralized approach?''}\\
\end{enumerate}
