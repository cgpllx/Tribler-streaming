Tribler features VoD on desktop environments, with which people can search for a video and immediately play it. Similar features do exist on mobile devices, for example, Youtube\footnote{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube} and ITV Player\footnote{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.ITVMobilePlayer} but they all require central servers in order to watch the videos presented. A non-centralized approach ensures that the application does not depend on one central unit which could go offline, for example due to disasters or political intervention. Applications that feature VoD are immensely popular. Youtube alone has one billion unique users who watch over six billion hours of video each month\footnote{http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html}. Combining VoD, non-centralization and the current market shift towards mobile devices is something to which, currently, no solution exists.
