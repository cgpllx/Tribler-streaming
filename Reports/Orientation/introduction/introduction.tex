Much of the current research activities in peer-to-peer(P2P) within the Parallel and Distributed Systems(PDS) group of the Delft Technical University (TU Delft) are centered around Tribler\footnote{http://www.tribler.org}. Tribler is an application that enables its users to find, consume and share content in a fully decentralized way. Another popular feature of Tribler is video-on-demand (VoD) where users can immediately watch the video they are downloading. Currently, mobile internet traffic continues to consistently gain on desktop traffic in terms of volume\footnote{http://gs.statcounter.com/mobile\_vs\_desktop\-ww\-monthly\-200812\-201306} and mobile traffic is estimated to surpass traffic from wired devices in 2017\footnote{http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/VNI\_Hyperconnectivity\_WP.pdf}. In response to this growth and to meet the increasing demands of the market, the development of a mobile version of the VoD feature in Tribler would be of great value.\\
This Orientation Report will describe the different techniques that could be used for implementing VoD in a non-centralized manner on mobile devices. The introduction chapter will describe the problem, the main research question and its subquestions. Chapter 2 will talk describe on which mobile platform the prototype will be implemented.
