\section{Conclusion}
Concluding, Libswift has the best start-up time, especially in the case of a steady-state scenerio, and the least number of average stalls per playback. This makes Libswift the best choice to implement as transport protocol, it is also developed by the PDS department where the team works, meaning that specialist information can be obtained when needed.
