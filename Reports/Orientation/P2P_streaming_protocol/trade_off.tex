\section{Trade-off}
The following comparison is aimed to see which protocol is best suited for VoD on mobile devices. The following criteria are considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item start-up time: how long it takes for a video stream to start playing.
	\item stalls experienced: how often does the playback stop because the next part of the video is not ready.
\end{itemize}
Both criteria are heavily dependant on the ratio of seeders to leechers in the swarm.
