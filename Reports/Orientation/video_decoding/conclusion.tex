\section{Conclusion}
As can be seen in the trade-off, VLC for Android supports the largest number of multimedia file formats. The Stagefright framework matches and in some cases exceeds the performance of VLC for Android, however only supports 5 video file formats which will greatly limit the versatility of the prototype application for this project. Dolphin Player does not have any key features that can compete with the other framework and its performance is unacceptable which renders it unsuitable to use as a video decoding framework for the prototype application. Therefore, VLC for Android is chosen as the framework that will be used in the prototype application.
