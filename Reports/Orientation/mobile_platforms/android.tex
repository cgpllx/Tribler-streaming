\section{Android}
Google has engineered Android\footnote{http://www.android.com/about/}, and it supports close to an estimated number of 4.000 different devices\footntoe{http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/15/3997-models-android-fragmentation-as-seen-by-the-developers-of-opensignalmaps/}. Android is built upon a Linux kernel and like its kernel, it is open source. There are over 800.000 applications in the 'Play store'\footnote{http://www.appbrain.com/stats/number-of-android-apps} excluding the latest addition of e-books.
