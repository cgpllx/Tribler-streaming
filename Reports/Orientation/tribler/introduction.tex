Tribler\footnote{www.tribler.org} is an application that enables its users to find, consume and share content through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The application is currently available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Tribler facilitates finding and sharing content in a fully decentralized manner so that no central server is needed. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of people who only download(leech) content, Tribler makes use of a reputation system which encourages users to actively participate in uploading (seeding) content.
