A lot of BitTorrent clients exist, such as uTorrent, MLDonkey, Miro, LimeWire, etc. The team needs to implement such a client to make VoD available for mobile devices. Not all clients support VoD, and the ones that do still need to be modified to be able to operate on Android, so they have to be open source in order to use and modify them. Because the aim of the project is to create VoD for Android powered devices, not all functionality of the open source BitTorrent clients that support VoD is needed. Because the team works at the department that created Tribler, the team can get a lot of information about how Tribler operates, which subsystems are useful for VoD and more. Tribler is therefore currently the best choice to implement as client.
