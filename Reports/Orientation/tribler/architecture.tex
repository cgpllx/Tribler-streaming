Tribler consists out of four major components as can also be seen in figure \ref{fig:tribler_components}\footnote {http://sigmm.org/records/records1201/featured03.html}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GUI: the graphical user interface.
	\item BTengine: the bittorrent engine.
	\item BuddyCast: a protocol for communication between peers
	\item Dispersy: a protocol similar in function to BuddyCast, but scalable.
\end{itemize}
