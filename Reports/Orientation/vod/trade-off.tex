\section{Trade-off}
In this section the different criteria for a good VoD service are elucidated. Also described in this section is in what manner the different services perform on these criteria.

\subsection{Non-centralization of servers}
No central server makes sure that the service has low, if any, hardware maintenance costs. Further more in a central server way, if the server fails, data might be lost and the service is out of order, this can not happen in a non-centralized approach with enough users, making this approach highly reliable. This also means that every user is part of the solution making it a community driven approach, where every user has influence (in terms of availability and range of content) on the system, the size of this influence depends on the number of users connected.
Of the VoD services that were previously described, only Tribler uses a non-centralized approach.
