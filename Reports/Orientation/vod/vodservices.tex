In this section, the most popular VoD services are discussed:

\subsection{ITV Player}
ITV Player is a VoD service which shows the programs broadcast on the TV-cable channels ITV1, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. It provides playback for shows up to 7 days after they aired on TV and after a free registration this becomes 30 days. The programs shown are therefore limited to those that were aired; ranging from TV-shows to live shows such as X-factor. The ITV Player runs on its website\footnote{http://www.itv.com}, desktop environments (Mac, Windows and Linux), PlayStation 3, iOS and on Android\footnote{https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/help/faq/1}. The ITV player does show advertisements before playback of every chosen video.

\subsection{Amazon Instant Video}
Amazon has a VoD service in which the user pays a yearly fee(\$79), after which they can watch a lot of content for free, some releases may not be free and an additional price must be paid to buy or rent the item. The application with which to watch the videos is available for: Windows, Kindle Fire (HD), Apple devices, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii (U), a number of set-top boxes\footnote{http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8\&docId=1000663511} and the so called: `smart TVs'\footnote{http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12}.

\subsection{YouTube}
YouTube started in 2005 and has quickly become the most popular VoD service. As said in section \ref{sec:motivation}, one billion unique users visit YouTube every month, adding up to 6 billion hours of videos watched each month. The service is available for desktop environments, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, game consoles and smart TVs. The videos available for playback are all added by users themselves. Anyone can upload a video, for example, companies that want to add a video of their latest product or news stations covering the latest events, but also parents can upload the footage of their baby's first steps. However, there are limits to what is allowed, which is included in their policy\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/yt/policyandsafety/policy.html}.
