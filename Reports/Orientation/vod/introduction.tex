As mentioned in the motivation, Video-on-Demand(VoD) is a widely popular feature. A lot of different services exist to provide this feature, such as Youtube, ITV\footnote{http://www.itv.com/}, Netflix\footnote{http://www.netflix.com} and Amazon Instant Video\footnote{http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8\&docId=1000663511}. Another VoD service is Tribler\footnote{http://www.tribler.org}, developed at the TU Delft by the Parallel and Distributed Systems(PDS) group. In essence, it is a BitTorrent\footnote{http://www.bittorrent.com/} client featuring VoD. In this chapter the previously stated possibilities for VoD will be described. First, a description of the first four mentioned VoD services will be given. After this, Tribler will be presented. This will be followed by a trade-off in which the services will be compared to find the most suitable service for Android. Finally a conclusion of this trade-off is included.
