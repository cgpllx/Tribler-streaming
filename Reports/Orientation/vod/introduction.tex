\section{Introduction}
As mentioned in the motivation, Video-on-Demand(VoD) is a widely popular feature. A lot of different services exist to provide this feature, such as Youtube, ITV\footnote{http://www.itv.com/}, Netflix\footnote{http://www.netflix.com} and Amazon Instant Video\footnote{http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8\&docId=1000663511}. Another VoD service is Tribler\footnote{http://www.tribler.org}, developed at the TU Delft by the Parallel and Distributed Systems(PDS) group, in essence, it is a BitTorrent client featuring VoD. In this chapter the previously stated possibilities for VoD will be described. First a description of the first four mentioned VoD services will be given. After which follows a section describing Tribler. This will be followed by a trade-off in which the services will be held against criteria such as centralization of servers, cost, range of video's, is it available for mobile devices, and if that isn't the case; how portable to mobile devices the service is and the limitations of these ports. Finally a conclusion of this trade-off is included.
