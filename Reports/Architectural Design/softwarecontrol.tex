At start-up, the system will initialize python environment, after which the Tribler core will be loaded. At the same time the VLC core will initialize and load the necessary video decoding modules. When all the required components have been initialized a GUI will be shown, containing a start button. The system will then perform the actions described in section \ref{sec:comp} and stream a video. While streaming, the playback can be paused, or the user can seek to a different part of the video using a slider control, after which the system will continue streaming from there. It should be note that in case the playback is paused, the system will continue downloading pieces of the video in the background. In case of a system crash, the system will restore playback of the video that was playing at the moment of the crash, at a point in time close to what it was before the crash occured.
%how is the control flow within the system for some use cases
