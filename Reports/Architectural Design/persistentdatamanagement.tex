\section{Persistent data management}
\label{sec:perdata}
The prototype application will have to be able to stream high definition videos that in case of Blu-ray video, can have a bitrate of up to 40 Mbit/s.\footnote{http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-ROM-AV-WhitePaper_100604\%281\%29-15916-18123.pdf}. In case a video is encoded in DivX Plus HD 1080p format, it can have a maximum bitrate of 20 Mbit/s.\footnote{http://www.divx.com/files/DivX_Plus_HD_Brochure.pdf} In order to decode video streams with such bitrates in real-time, data will have to be downloaded into RAM, after which it can directly decoded. The contiguous pieces that are downloaded from the peers will therefore be stored in a buffer that resides in RAM. At the same time, the piece can also be stored to non-volatile storage such as onboard Flash Memory, or to an external SD-card in case recording of the video stream is required.
